Pluralsight course: C# Best Practices: Collections and Generics
Instructor: Deborah Kurata

This course covers best practices for using C# collections and generics, guiding you on the path from apprentice, to skilled C# software developer.

When building applications we often deal with groups of things: a user's preferences, a customer's orders, or a product's color choices. To implement these groups of things in C#, we use collections. And to get the most from collections, we need to leverage generics. This course covers how, when, why, and best practices for using C# collections and generics, including arrays, generic interfaces, LINQ, delegates, and Lambda expressions.
